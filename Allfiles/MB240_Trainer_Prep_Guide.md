# MB-240T00: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service Trainer Preparation Guide

## Required Materials to Teach This Course

To teach this course, you need the following materials:

- Microsoft PowerPoint files
- Student manual
- Student lab instructions

## Prerequisite Knowledge to Teach This Course

To successfully teach these courses, instructors must have experience leveraging the following:

- The Power Platform (including Power Apps, Power BI and Microsoft Power Automate)
- Dynamics 365 Field Service expertise
- Dynamics 365 (including the first-party model-driven applications)
- Project processes, methodologies and best practices

## Preparation Tasks

Instructors should complete the following tasks to prepare for each of the courses in the Dynamics 365 series:

- Review all topics in the student manual. You should be well-versed in every topic.
- Review all PowerPoint slides and make notes to match your specific teaching style. Add notes in the notes pane where necessary.
- Be able to speak to each of the talking points or graphics on the slides. Be aware of the topic in the Student Manual that each slide aligns to.
- Not only should you review the labs, but you should be able to  successfully complete them so that you become familiar with any of the difficult points. This will prepare you for helping students in class.

## Course Timing

This course is expected to take 3 full (8 hour) days, including labs (with breaks taken into consideration). The course breakdown is 60% lecture and 40% labs.

We appreciate any feedback you can provide about timing considerations or scheduling changes that emerge during a live course.

### Lab Timing

Labs are divided by module. Labs can either be completed either at the end of lessons within the modules, or at the end of the entire module. You can find the labs that correspond to that module in the trainer PowerPoint slides.

|Module #|Lab #|Lab|Time|
|---|---|---|---|
|0|0|Validate lab environment|15 minutes|
|1|1|Configure Field Service|10 minutes|
|1|2|Skills and characteristics|20 minutes|
|1|3|Resources|20 minutes|
|2|4|Incident types|15 minutes|
|2|5|Work order management|50 minutes|
|2|6|Agreements|20 minutes|
|2|7|Inspections|15 minutes|
|3|8|Managing schedules|15 minutes|
|3|9|Configure Schedule Boards|10 minutes|
|4|10|Field Service mobile app|30 minutes|
|5|11|Inventory|10 minutes|
|6|12|Customer assets|25 minutes|
|7|13|Customize Schedule Boards|50 minutes|
|7|14|Create survey|25 minutes|

## Lab Specification Guide

The MB-240 course provides a set of lab instructions in GitHub. These labs align with the content of certain modules within the course. You will find placeholder slides in the Instructor PowerPoint decks for each lab. Based on timing necessities or your own teaching preferences, you may choose to move these slides to different parts of the course and teach the labs at different points.

### Lab Credentials

Almost all steps in the labs are performed in the Power Platform and Microsoft 365 tenants that learners acquire through the authorized lab hosting (ALH) provider. Since the labs are tenant-based and those tenants update each month, it is possible that some of the lab instructions become out of sync with the updated tenant. While we try to update the lab instructions regularly, be aware of this possibility.

Each student should be supplied with the following through the lab hosting provider:

- A blank virtual machine
- A Microsoft 365 tenant credential
- Access to a shared Dynamics 365 Field Service environment

Students should record these credentials upon their receipt and continue using the same credentials throughout the duration of the course.

### Lab Demos

To build a demo environment, you could complete the labs as a student would and use those as examples as needed for your demos. Demos are not required for each module. Do a few on topics that you feel most comfortable.

### Lab Instructions

Student lab instructions are hosted on the public GitHub repository <https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/MB-240-Dynamics365forFieldService> for MB-240 in Markdown format.

Due to the dynamic nature of the products, we expect that the user experience of the technology will not always match the lab instructions perfectly. We encourage MCTs to contribute to the lab manuals when a bug is noticed during course facilitation by creating a Pull Request.

Students can access the lab manuals using the more user-friendly GitHub pages feature <https://microsoftlearning.github.io/MB-240-Dynamics365forFieldService/>. MCTs can distribute this link to students at their convenience. Please be aware that authorized lab hosters will often surface our lab instructions within their own user interface. These instructions are surfaced from a dynamic pull from our GitHub repositories, so they should always remain current with our GitHub site.
